  "about": "## About me\nHello, my name is Nicat. I was born in Georgia in 2003. I finished high school in 2021, the same year I won the computer science department of Tbilisi State University. I like coding and improving myself. I love reading articles about software, especially when learning a new technology.\n## How I started writing code?\nI started writing code about 3-4 years ago. At that time, I was developing scripts for servers. Then I wanted to do something different and found myself writing code for the web. I learned python because python was simple for me compared to other languages, then I learned Javascript. \n## My Projects\n- **[Battle Royale](https://github.com/NicatMirzaev/battleroyale)** - It is the Python coded version of the Battle Royale game developed by [Selman Kahya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ittu8H2EhBw) in a live broadcast. Developed with Pygame. The server side is coded with socket.\n- **[Space War](https://github.com/NicatMirzaev/spacewar)** - It is a game developed with Python. Your goal is to score by shooting other spaceships.\n- **[Intelligent Driver](https://github.com/NicatMirzaev/intelligent-driver)** - A simpler version of the self-driving car that [Selman Kahya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ3Ndr0ZZdU&list=PLTXQHe5cDvq0GM7p7VBXjQ6RyKVi1PDt7&index=13)  developed in the live broadcast. It moves according to its 3 (right, left and front) sensors, there is no neural network. Road drawings are made by the user.\n- **[HardCode](https://github.com/NicatMirzaev/hardcode-frontend)** - A platform where members solve different problems using the programming language of their choice (hackerrank style). You level up by solving problems.\n- **[Twitter UI Clone](https://github.com/NicatMirzaev/twitter-ui-clone)** - The UI of Twitter's homepage, which I coded to improve my HTML and CSS skills.\n- **[Reddit Clone](https://github.com/NicatMirzaev/reddit-clone)** -  The UI of Reddit's homepage, which I coded to improve my HTML and CSS skills.\n- **[Chat App](https://github.com/NicatMirzaev/chat-app-vuejs)** - A simple chat application that I developed while learning VueJS. By entering your name and the name of the room you want to log in, you can message the members in that room.",
